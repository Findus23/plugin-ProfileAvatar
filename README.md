# Matomo ProfileAvatar Plugin

## Description

Are you tired of always seeing the same placeholder profile picture in the Vistitor Profile?

This plugin creates randomly generated user avatars based on the visitorID inspired by classical identicons:

- Cat Avatar (based on [cat-avatar-generator](https://framagit.org/Deevad/cat-avatar-generator/) by [David Revoy](https://www.davidrevoy.com/))
- Bird Avatar (the same with birds)
- MonsterID (based on [MonsterID](https://www.splitbrain.org/projects/monsterid) by Andreas Gohr)
- Identicon (based on [indenticon.js](https://github.com/stewartlord/identicon.js) by Stewart Lord)
- Blockies (based on [blockies](https://github.com/download13/blockies) by Erin Dachtler)

In the Personal Settings every use can choose which avatar type they want to see. 
No data is shared with other services as all images are generated locally.
